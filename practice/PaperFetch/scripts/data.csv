Challenges in Credit Assignment for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Open Agent Systems,"In the rapidly evolving field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), understanding the dynamics of open systems is crucial. Openness in MARL refers to the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a system. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et al. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at any time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or disappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents change over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review, focusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem (CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the overall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open environ-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static agent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making them inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis, in-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent turnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental stationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We then present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural algorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness directly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and significant performance degradation.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27659
Learning Sparse Approximate Inverse Preconditioners for Conjugate Gradient Solvers on GPUs,"The conjugate gradient solver (CG) is a prevalent method for solving symmetric and positive definite linear systems Ax=b, where effective preconditioners are crucial for fast convergence. Traditional preconditioners rely on prescribed algorithms to offer rigorous theoretical guarantees, while limiting their ability to exploit optimization from data. Existing learning-based methods often utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve the performance and speed up the construction. However, their reliance on incomplete factorization leads to significant challenges: the associated triangular solve hinders GPU parallelization in practice, and introduces long-range dependencies which are difficult for GNNs to model. To address these issues, we propose a learning-based method to generate GPU-friendly preconditioners, particularly using GNNs to construct Sparse Approximate Inverse (SPAI) preconditioners, which avoids triangular solves and requires only two matrix-vector products at each CG step. The locality of matrix-vector product is compatible with the local propagation mechanism of GNNs. The flexibility of GNNs also allows our approach to be applied in a wide range of scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a statistics-based scale-invariant loss function. Its design matches CG's property that the convergence rate depends on the condition number, rather than the absolute scale of A, leading to improved performance of the learned preconditioner. Evaluations on three PDE-derived datasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms standard preconditioners (Diagonal, IC, and traditional SPAI) and previous learning-based preconditioners on GPUs. We reduce solution time on GPUs by 40%-53% (68%-113% faster), along with better condition numbers and superior generalization performance.

Spectral Neural Graph Sparsification,"Graphs are central to modeling complex systems in domains such as social networks, molecular chemistry, and neuroscience. While Graph Neural Networks, particularly Graph Convolutional Networks, have become standard tools for graph learning, they remain constrained by reliance on fixed structures and susceptibility to over-smoothing. We propose the Spectral Preservation Network, a new framework for graph representation learning that generates reduced graphs serving as faithful proxies of the original, enabling downstream tasks such as community detection, influence propagation, and information diffusion at a reduced computational cost. The Spectral Preservation Network introduces two key components: the Joint Graph Evolution layer and the Spectral Concordance loss. The former jointly transforms both the graph topology and the node feature matrix, allowing the structure and attributes to evolve adaptively across layers and overcoming the rigidity of static neighborhood aggregation. The latter regularizes these transformations by enforcing consistency in both the spectral properties of the graph and the feature vectors of the nodes. We evaluate the effectiveness of Spectral Preservation Network on node-level sparsification by analyzing well-established metrics and benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance and clear advantages of our approach.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27474
Reasoning Models Sometimes Output Illegible Chains of Thought,"Language models trained via outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to reason using chain-of-thought (CoT) have shown remarkable performance. Monitoring such a model's CoT may allow us to understand its intentions and detect potential malicious behavior. However, to be effective, this requires that CoTs are legible and faithful. We study CoT legibility across 14 reasoning models, finding that RL often causes reasoning to become illegible to both humans and AI monitors, with reasoning models (except Claude) generating illegible CoTs while returning to perfectly readable final answers. We show that models use illegible reasoning to reach correct answers (accuracy dropping by 53\% when forced to use only legible portions), yet find no correlation between legibility and performance when resampling - suggesting the relationship is more nuanced. We also find that legibility degrades on harder questions. We discuss potential hypotheses for these results, including steganography, training artifacts, and vestigial tokens. These results suggest that without explicit optimization for legibility, outcome-based RL naturally produces models with increasingly opaque reasoning processes, potentially undermining monitoring approaches.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27338
MDAS-GNN: Multi-Dimensional Spatiotemporal GNN with Spatial Diffusion for Urban Traffic Risk Forecasting,"Traffic accidents represent a critical public health challenge, claiming over 1.35 million lives annually worldwide. Traditional accident prediction models treat road segments independently, failing to capture complex spatial relationships and temporal dependencies in urban transportation networks. This study develops MDAS-GNN, a Multi-Dimensional Attention-based Spatial-diffusion Graph Neural Network integrating three core risk dimensions: traffic safety, infrastructure, and environmental risk. The framework employs feature-specific spatial diffusion mechanisms and multi-head temporal attention to capture dependencies across different time horizons. Evaluated on UK Department for Transport accident data across Central London, South Manchester, and SE Birmingham, MDASGNN achieves superior performance compared to established baseline methods. The model maintains consistently low prediction errors across short, medium, and long-term periods, with particular strength in long-term forecasting. Ablation studies confirm that integrated multi-dimensional features outperform singlefeature approaches, reducing prediction errors by up to 40%. This framework provides civil engineers and urban planners with advanced predictive capabilities for transportation infrastructure design, enabling data-driven decisions for road network optimization, infrastructure resource improvements, and strategic safety interventions in urban development projects.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27197
Relation-Aware Bayesian Optimization of DBMS Configurations Guided by Affinity Scores,"Database Management Systems (DBMSs) are fundamental for managing large-scale and heterogeneous data, and their performance is critically influenced by configuration parameters. Effective tuning of these parameters is essential for adapting to diverse workloads and maximizing throughput while minimizing latency. Recent research has focused on automated configuration optimization using machine learning; however, existing approaches still exhibit several key limitations. Most tuning frameworks disregard the dependencies among parameters, assuming that each operates independently. This simplification prevents optimizers from leveraging relational effects across parameters, limiting their capacity to capture performancesensitive interactions. Moreover, to reduce the complexity of the high-dimensional search space, prior work often selects only the top few parameters for optimization, overlooking others that contribute meaningfully to performance. Bayesian Optimization (BO), the most common method for automatic tuning, is also constrained by its reliance on surrogate models, which can lead to unstable predictions and inefficient exploration. To overcome these limitations, we propose RelTune, a novel framework that represents parameter dependencies as a Relational Graph and learns GNN-based latent embeddings that encode performancerelevant semantics. RelTune further introduces Hybrid-Score-Guided Bayesian Optimization (HBO), which combines surrogate predictions with an Affinity Score measuring proximity to previously high-performing configurations. Experimental results on multiple DBMSs and workloads demonstrate that RelTune achieves faster convergence and higher optimization efficiency than conventional BO-based methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated scenarios.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27145
Towards Understanding Self-play for LLM Reasoning,"Recent advances in large language model (LLM) reasoning, led by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), have inspired self-play post-training, where models improve by generating and solving their own problems. While self-play has shown strong in-domain and out-of-domain gains, the mechanisms behind these improvements remain poorly understood. In this work, we analyze the training dynamics of self-play through the lens of the Absolute Zero Reasoner, comparing it against RLVR and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our study examines parameter update sparsity, entropy dynamics of token distributions, and alternative proposer reward functions. We further connect these dynamics to reasoning performance using pass@k evaluations. Together, our findings clarify how self-play differs from other post-training strategies, highlight its inherent limitations, and point toward future directions for improving LLM math reasoning through self-play.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27072
Limits of Generalization in RLVR: Two Case Studies in Mathematical Reasoning,"Mathematical reasoning is a central challenge for large language models (LLMs), requiring not only correct answers but also faithful reasoning processes. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing such capabilities; however, its ability to foster genuine reasoning remains unclear. We investigate RLVR on two combinatorial problems with fully verifiable solutions: \emph{Activity Scheduling} and the \emph{Longest Increasing Subsequence}, using carefully curated datasets with unique optima. Across multiple reward designs, we find that RLVR improves evaluation metrics but often by reinforcing superficial heuristics rather than acquiring new reasoning strategies. These findings highlight the limits of RLVR generalization, emphasizing the importance of benchmarks that disentangle genuine mathematical reasoning from shortcut exploitation and provide faithful measures of progress.

A Framework for Fair Evaluation of Variance-Aware Bandit Algorithms,"Multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems serve as a fundamental building block for more complex reinforcement learning algorithms. However, evaluating and comparing MAB algorithms remains challenging due to the lack of standardized conditions and replicability. This is particularly problematic for variance-aware extensions of classical methods like UCB, whose performance can heavily depend on the underlying environment. In this study, we address how performance differences between bandit algorithms can be reliably observed, and under what conditions variance-aware algorithms outperform classical ones. We present a reproducible evaluation designed to systematically compare eight classical and variance-aware MAB algorithms. The evaluation framework, implemented in our Bandit Playground codebase, features clearly defined experimental setups, multiple performance metrics (reward, regret, reward distribution, value-at-risk, and action optimality), and an interactive evaluation interface that supports consistent and transparent analysis. We show that variance-aware algorithms can offer advantages in settings with high uncertainty where the difficulty arises from subtle differences between arm rewards. In contrast, classical algorithms often perform equally well or better in more separable scenarios or if fine-tuned extensively. Our contributions are twofold: (1) a framework for systematic evaluation of MAB algorithms, and (2) insights into the conditions under which variance-aware approaches outperform their classical counterparts.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27001
When AI Trading Agents Compete: Adverse Selection of Meta-Orders by Reinforcement Learning-Based Market Making,"We investigate the mechanisms by which medium-frequency trading agents are adversely selected by opportunistic high-frequency traders. We use reinforcement learning (RL) within a Hawkes Limit Order Book (LOB) model in order to replicate the behaviours of high-frequency market makers. In contrast to the classical models with exogenous price impact assumptions, the Hawkes model accounts for endogenous price impact and other key properties of the market (Jain et al. 2024a). Given the real-world impracticalities of the market maker updating strategies for every event in the LOB, we formulate the high-frequency market making agent via an impulse control reinforcement learning framework (Jain et al. 2025). The RL used in the simulation utilises Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) and self-imitation learning. To replicate the adverse selection phenomenon, we test the RL agent trading against a medium frequency trader (MFT) executing a meta-order and demonstrate that, with training against the MFT meta-order execution agent, the RL market making agent learns to capitalise on the price drift induced by the meta-order. Recent empirical studies have shown that medium-frequency traders are increasingly subject to adverse selection by high-frequency trading agents. As high-frequency trading continues to proliferate across financial markets, the slippage costs incurred by medium-frequency traders are likely to increase over time. However, we do not observe that increased profits for the market making RL agent necessarily cause significantly increased slippages for the MFT agent.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27334
AURA: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for AI-Driven Adaptive Conversational Surveys,"Conventional online surveys provide limited personalization, often resulting in low engagement and superficial responses. Although AI survey chatbots improve convenience, most are still reactive: they rely on fixed dialogue trees or static prompt templates and therefore cannot adapt within a session to fit individual users, which leads to generic follow-ups and weak response quality. We address these limitations with AURA (Adaptive Understanding through Reinforcement Learning for Assessment), a reinforcement learning framework for AI-driven adaptive conversational surveys. AURA quantifies response quality using a four-dimensional LSDE metric (Length, Self-disclosure, Emotion, and Specificity) and selects follow-up question types via an epsilon-greedy policy that updates the expected quality gain within each session. Initialized with priors extracted from 96 prior campus-climate conversations (467 total chatbot-user exchanges), the system balances exploration and exploitation across 10-15 dialogue exchanges, dynamically adapting to individual participants in real time. In controlled evaluations, AURA achieved a +0.12 mean gain in response quality and a statistically significant improvement over non-adaptive baselines (p=0.044, d=0.66), driven by a 63% reduction in specification prompts and a 10x increase in validation behavior. These results demonstrate that reinforcement learning can give survey chatbots improved adaptivity, transforming static questionnaires into interactive, self-improving assessment systems.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27126
e1: Learning Adaptive Control of Reasoning Effort,"Increasing the thinking budget of AI models can significantly improve accuracy, but not all questions warrant the same amount of reasoning. Users may prefer to allocate different amounts of reasoning effort depending on how they value output quality versus latency and cost. To leverage this tradeoff effectively, users need fine-grained control over the amount of thinking used for a particular query, but few approaches enable such control. Existing methods require users to specify the absolute number of desired tokens, but this requires knowing the difficulty of the problem beforehand to appropriately set the token budget for a query. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Effort Control, a self-adaptive reinforcement learning method that trains models to use a user-specified fraction of tokens relative to the current average chain-of-thought length for each query. This approach eliminates dataset- and phase-specific tuning while producing better cost-accuracy tradeoff curves compared to standard methods. Users can dynamically adjust the cost-accuracy trade-off through a continuous effort parameter specified at inference time. We observe that the model automatically learns to allocate resources proportionally to the task difficulty and, across model scales ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, our approach enables approximately 3x reduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving performance relative to the base model used for RL training.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27042
A Non-Variational Quantum Approach to the Job Shop Scheduling Problem,"Quantum heuristics offer a potential advantage for combinatorial optimization but are constrained by near-term hardware limitations. We introduce Iterative-QAOA, a variant of QAOA designed to mitigate these constraints. The algorithm combines a non-variational, shallow-depth circuit approach using fixed-parameter schedules with an iterative warm-starting process. We benchmark the algorithm on Just-in-Time Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JIT-JSSP) instances on IonQ Forte Generation QPUs, representing some of the largest such problems ever executed on quantum hardware. We compare the performance of the algorithm against both the Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (VarQITE) algorithm and the non-variational Linear Ramp (LR) QAOA algorithm. We find that Iterative-QAOA robustly converges to find optimal solutions as well as high-quality, near-optimal solutions for all problem instances evaluated. We evaluate the algorithm on larger problem instances up to 97 qubits using tensor network simulations. The scaling behavior of the algorithm indicates potential for solving industrial-scale problems on fault-tolerant quantum computers.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26859
